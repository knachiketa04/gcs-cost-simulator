# 🚀 GCS Storage Strategy Simulator

## ⚠️ **Educational Disclaimer**

**This tool is designed for educational purposes and cost estimation guidance only.** While it models GCS pricing and behavior based on publicly available Google Cloud documentation, it should not be used as the sole basis for commercial decisions or production deployments.

**For commercial use and production environments:**

- Always conduct thorough testing with your actual data and access patterns
- Consult official [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs)
- Validate pricing with the [Google Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator)
- Consider engaging with Google Cloud specialists for enterprise scenarios

Streamlit application that compares Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Autoclass vs Lifecycle Policies with comprehensive cost modeling, intelligent unit scaling, and realistic API operation charges.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 **Three Analysis Modes**

- **🤖 Autoclass Only**: Intelligent, access-based storage optimization with configurable terminal storage class
- **📋 Lifecycle Only**: Time-based storage transitions with custom transition rules
- **⚖️ Side-by-Side Comparison**: Direct cost and performance comparison with strategic insights

### 💰 **Comprehensive Cost Modeling**

- **Accurate GCS Pricing**: Regional pricing (default: Iowa us-central1) with full customization
- **Automatic Upload Costs**: Class A operation charges calculated for monthly data uploads
- **Strategy-Specific Costs**: Autoclass management fees vs lifecycle retrieval costs
- **Transition Operations**: Proper modeling of lifecycle and autoclass transition charges
- **Object Size Compliance**: Strict 128 KiB Autoclass eligibility enforcement

### 📊 **Smart Analytics & Export**

- **Detailed API Breakdown**: Upload, user-defined, and system transition operations tracked separately
- **Auto-Scaling Units**: Intelligent GB→TiB, $→$M scaling for large datasets
- **Professional Reports**: PDF executive summaries with comprehensive cost breakdowns
- **Raw Data Export**: CSV export for further analysis and integration
- **TCO Validation**: Comprehensive error checking and configuration warnings

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+, Streamlit 1.30.0+, Pandas, Matplotlib, ReportLab

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

**Compare GCS storage strategies** with realistic enterprise scenarios:

- **Data Growth Modeling**: TB-scale datasets with configurable monthly growth (0-50%)
- **Realistic API Costing**: Automatic Class A upload operations plus user-defined operations
- **Access Pattern Configuration**: Conditional UI adapts based on terminal storage and access rates
- **Generation-Based Tracking**: Accurate data aging and lifecycle cost calculations
- **Long-Term Analysis**: 12-60 month simulations with generation optimization for performance

### 🎨 **Advanced Features**

- **Terminal Storage Configuration**: Nearline (GCS default) or Archive terminal classes
- **Smart UI Logic**: Conditional controls hide irrelevant options based on configuration
- **Cost Impact Analysis**: High-impact warnings for configurations affecting >30% of costs
- **Chart Visualization**: Side-by-side data distribution and cost comparison charts

## 📊 Default Configuration

- **Storage Classes**: Standard → Nearline (30d) → Coldline (90d) → Archive (365d)
- **Access Rates**: Standard 40% hot, Nearline 20%, Coldline 15%, Archive 15%
- **Object Sizes**: Large objects 512 KiB (Autoclass eligible), Small objects 64 KiB
- **Terminal Storage**: Archive (full progression enabled)
- **API Operations**: Automatic upload costs + configurable additional operations
